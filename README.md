# Fashion-MNIST-Dataset
Machine Learning
We use the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels), as seen here:

The images are 28x28 NumPy arrays, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. The labels are an array of integers, ranging from 0 to 9. These correspond to the class of clothing the image represents:

Label	Class>
0	--T-shirt/top,
1	--Trouser,
2	--Pullover,
3	--Dress,
4	--Coat,
5	--Sandal,
6	--Shirt,
7	--Sneaker,
8	--Bag,
9	--Ankle boot.
